			<p class="p1">Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae.<br>
				They prefer to stay near water.<br>
				Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. </p>

				<li><span>Family‎</span>: Elephantidae</li>
				<li><span>Kingdom</span>: ‎Animalia</li>
				<li><span>Order‎</span>: ‎Proboscidea</li>
				<li><span>Class‎</span>: ‎Mammalia</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p2">Elephants are the only remaining members of the Proboscidea order of mammals. <br>
				The order included the extinct wooly mammoth and American mastodon. <br>
Elephants are a “keystone species.” If a keystone species disappears through extinction <br>
or removal, the entire ecosystem would change drastically. Other species rely on the keystone species for survival.</p>
